## Performance Interpretation

### Overall Assessment
The strategy experienced a negative return of -20.57% over the testing period, with poor risk-adjusted returns as indicated by a low Sharpe ratio.

### Risk Assessment
The strategy experienced a maximum drawdown of 53.79%, which represents the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value. This high drawdown indicates significant risk and potential for large losses.

### Trading Effectiveness
The strategy achieved a win rate of 48.1% with an order execution success rate of 85.3%. The win rate below 50% suggests the strategy may need refinement, though this could be acceptable if winning trades are larger than losing ones.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis:

1. **Risk Management**: Consider implementing stricter risk controls to reduce drawdown.
2. **Strategy Optimization**: Focus on improving trade selection criteria to increase win rate.
3. **Performance**: The strategy requires further development before considering live implementation.
